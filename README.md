# matlab-singlepulseTMS-expt
MATLAB code for single-pulse TMS experiment on gesture and language comprehension:

This is MATLAB code for an experiment investigating how language affects motor activity, in response to different hand gestures.  Single-pulse TMS was used at different time-points according to onsets of different gesture videos (with accompanying statements by the speaker).  This code was designed for running on Mac's (so PC's might run into a few issues), and it depends on having Psychtoolbox installed (http://psychtoolbox.org/).  To request access to the gesture videos, email carr324@gmail.com.
